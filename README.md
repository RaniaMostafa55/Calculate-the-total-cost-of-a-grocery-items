Task1

A new Dart project.

## Getting Started

This project helps you calculate the total price of grocery items by these steps:
1. Create a list of maps, each map contains the name of the item and its price
2. Create a constant variable to hold the tax rate
3. Create a "total" variable to add all the prices
4. Use a "for loop" to iterate in the items list and add each item price to the "total" variable
5. Add the tax to the total price
6. Finally, print the total price before and after adding tax to the total price
